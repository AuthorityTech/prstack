The AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) industry has a new favorite myth: "Just add schema markup and AI engines will cite you." It's being sold by SEO consultants pivoting to AEO, repeated in LinkedIn posts, and codified in "best practices" guides across the web.

**There's one problem: it's not true.**

Structured data matters for traditional SEO. It helps search engines understand your content's structure and context. But when it comes to getting cited in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and other AI answer engines, schema markup is neither sufficient nor, in many cases, necessary.

## What Actually Drives AI Citations

Analysis of thousands of AI engine citations reveals these patterns:

1. **Editorial Authority + Third-Party Validation** – AI engines cite news outlets, academic institutions, and industry reports far more than brand websites
2. **Semantic Depth + Comprehensive Coverage** – 3000-word deep dives get cited more than 500-word summaries, regardless of schema
3. **Freshness + Timeliness** – Recent content on evolving topics outranks older content with perfect schema
4. **Natural Language + Conversational Framing** – Content that mirrors how people ask questions gets cited more
5. **Backlink Profile + Entity Recognition** – Off-site SEO drives AI citations more than on-site schema

**The contrarian take:** Schema markup is a footnote in AEO strategy, not the strategy itself. The brands winning in AI search aren't the ones with the best structured data—they're the ones earning citations from authoritative sources, publishing exceptional content, and being recognized as credible entities across the web.
