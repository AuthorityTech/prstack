# The AI Search Monetization Cliff: What Happens When Free Ends

Every AI search engine is burning money. ChatGPT Search, Perplexity, Gemini—they're all subsidizing user acquisition with investor capital, offering "free" search that costs them $0.03-$0.15 per query. When the funding runs out, what replaces it?

And more importantly: **what happens to brands who've built their entire AEO strategy on platforms that suddenly need to monetize?**

## The Cost Structure Nobody Talks About

- GPT-4 API calls: $0.03-$0.15 per query
- Perplexity: ~100M queries/month = $3M-$15M in inference costs alone
- No sustainable revenue model beyond subscriptions
- Industry consensus: 12-24 months until major monetization shifts

## Three Monetization Scenarios

1. **Premium Tiers** (Most Likely) - Free with ads, paid ad-free
2. **Sponsored Answers** (Already Starting) - Pay-to-play for visibility
3. **Publisher Revenue Sharing** (Unlikely) - Licensing deals with major publications

## Why This Matters NOW

The brands building AI citations while it's "free" will have baseline visibility when monetization hits. Waiting means starting from zero in a pay-to-play environment.

**The 12-18 month window is closing.**
