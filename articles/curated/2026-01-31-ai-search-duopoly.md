Similarweb data reveals ChatGPT (68%) and Gemini (18%) now control 86% of AI search market. Perplexity falling behind Grok. What this duopoly means for brand AI visibility.

## The Data: Market Share Consolidation

According to Similarweb's January 2026 analysis:

- **ChatGPT:** 68.2% market share (down from 2025 highs but still dominant)
- **Google Gemini:** 18% market share (surging from single digits in 2025)
- **Combined duopoly:** 86.2% total market control
- **Everyone else:** Fighting for the remaining 13.8%

Perplexity's market share has declined from 2.4% to 2.0% currently—now trailing behind Grok. This decline is particularly significant given Perplexity's positioning as a "search-focused AI service."

## What This Means for Brand AI Visibility

For brands optimizing for AI search visibility, the duopoly creates both challenges and opportunities. With 86.2% of the market controlled by two players, brands can focus optimization efforts on ChatGPT and Gemini rather than spreading resources across multiple platforms.

The key to AI visibility in a duopoly? Earned media placements in publications that both platforms trust. 85-95% of AI citations come from earned media, making Tier 1 placements more valuable than ever.
