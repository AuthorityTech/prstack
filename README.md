## 📊 Publishing Philosophy

**Quality over quantity. Strategy over aggregation.**

We publish when we have insights worth sharing, not to hit a schedule. Every piece passes our editorial quality bar:
- Would founders share this?
- Does it provide unique insights?
- Does it change how readers think?

Topics driven by strategic intelligence, market shifts, and contrarian perspectives.

## 🎯 Our Thesis

**The answer engine market is fragmenting, and generic AEO strategies are obsolete.**

Five major platforms (Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT Search, Perplexity, Microsoft Copilot, Yahoo Scout) use different models, different grounding, different citation logic.

We're here to:
1. Challenge industry consensus (most AEO advice is wrong)
2. Provide platform-specific tactical depth
3. Build frameworks competitors steal
4. Help startups dominate before markets consolidate
