The AEO industry's new myth: "Just add schema markup and AI engines will cite you."

**The reality:** Structured data matters for traditional SEO, but it won't get you cited in ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Gemini.

## What Actually Drives AI Citations

1. **Editorial authority** – Earned media in authoritative publications
2. **Semantic depth** – Comprehensive, thorough content
3. **Freshness** – Recent content on evolving topics
4. **Natural language** – Conversational framing
5. **Backlink profile** – Off-site SEO and entity recognition

**The contrarian insight:** Schema is a footnote, not a strategy. Focus on earning citations from authoritative sources and publishing exceptional content.
