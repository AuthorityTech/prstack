# How to Write Content That AI Engines Actually Cite in 2026

Your article ranks #1 on Google for "performance PR strategy." ChatGPT recommends your competitor's #7 result instead. Welcome to the citation gap.

AI engines don't read content the way search crawlers index it. They optimize for semantic clarity, authoritative attribution, and structured answers—not keyword placement.

## The Seven Editorial Principles

1. **Answer-First Structure** - Lead with your thesis in the first 200 words
2. **Entity Clarity** - Define every company, person, and concept explicitly
3. **Source Attribution** - Cite authoritative sources with inline links
4. **Semantic Depth** - Write 1,500-2,500 word authoritative content
5. **Quotable Stats** - Include specific, verifiable data points
6. **Structured Answers** - Use headers that match natural language queries
7. **Recency Signals** - Include dates, current data, recent events

This guide provides tactical examples for each principle, showing what makes content citeable by ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini.
