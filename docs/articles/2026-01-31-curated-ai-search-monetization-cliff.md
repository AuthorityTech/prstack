# The AI Search Monetization Cliff: What Happens When Free Ends

Every AI search engine is burning money. ChatGPT Search, Perplexity, Gemini—they're all subsidizing user acquisition with investor capital, offering "free" search that costs them $0.03-$0.15 per query.

When the funding runs out, what replaces it?

## The Unsustainable Economics

- GPT-4 API costs: $0.03-$0.15 per query
- Perplexity: ~100M queries/month = $3M-$15M in inference costs
- No sustainable revenue beyond subscriptions
- Industry consensus: **12-24 months** until monetization

## Three Monetization Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Premium Tiers (Most Likely)**  
Free with ads + paid ad-free tier. Your organic citations compete with competitor ads.

**Scenario 2: Sponsored Answers (Already Starting)**  
Pay-to-play for visibility. Perplexity already testing sponsored content in answers.

**Scenario 3: Publisher Revenue Sharing (Unlikely)**  
Licensing deals with major publications. Tier-1 earned media becomes even more valuable.

## Why This Matters NOW

Brands building AI citations while it's "free" will have baseline visibility when monetization hits. Waiting means starting from zero in a pay-to-play environment.

**The accumulation effect:**
- 2024-2025: Free AI search, brands build citation footprint
- 2026: Monetization begins, existing citations provide baseline
- 2027+: Brands without citation history must pay for visibility

**The 12-18 month window is closing.**
